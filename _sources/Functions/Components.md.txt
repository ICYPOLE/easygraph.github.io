 ## Components

Easy Graph can help users check whether the graph (undirected) is connected/biconnected or not. It can also provide with connected/biconnected components.

### Connected Components

Returns whether the graph is connected or not.

```python
# G: <class 'Graph'>
is_connected(G)
```

Returns the number of connected components of graph.

```python
number_connected_components(G)
```

Returns the connected components of each node in graph.

```python
connected_components(G)
```

Returns the connected component of one node `Jack`.

```python
connected_component_of_node(G, node='Jack')
```



### Biconnected Components

Returns whether the graph is biconnected or not.

```python
# G: <class 'Graph'>
is_biconnected(G)
```

Returns the biconnected components of each node in graph.

```python
connected_components(G)
```

Returns a generator of nodes in all biconnected components.

```python
generator_biconnected_components_nodes(G)
```

Returns a generator of edges in all biconnected components.

```python
generator_biconnected_components_edges(G)
```

Returns a generator of the articulation points.

```python
generator_articulation_points(G)
```
